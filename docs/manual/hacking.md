# Hacking neovim-flake {#ch-hacking}

neovim-flake is designed for developers as much as it is for the end user. I would like any potential contributor
to be able to propagate their desired changes into the repository without the extra effort. As such, below are guides
(and guidelines) to streamline the contribution process and ensure that your valuable input seamlessly integrates
into neovim-flake's development without leaving question marks in your head.

This section is mainly directed towards those who wish to contribute code into neovim-flake. If you wish to instead
report a bug or discuss a potential feature implementation, first look among the
already [open issues](https://github.com/notashelf/neovim-flake/issues) and if no matching issue exists you may open
a [new issue](https://github.com/notashelf/neovim-flake/issues/new) and describe your problem/request. While creating an
issue, please try to include as much information as you can, ideally also include relevant context in which an issue
occurs or a feature should be implemented.
