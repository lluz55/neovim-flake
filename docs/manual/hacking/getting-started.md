# Getting Started {#sec-contrib-getting-started}

You naturally would like to start by forking the repository. If you are new to git, have a look at GitHub's
[Fork a repo guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for instructions on how you can do this. Once you have a fork of neovim-flake
you should create a branch starting at the most recent `main` branch.
Give your branch a reasonably descriptive name, suffixed by its type - i.e `feature/debugger` or `fix/pesky-bug`.

Implement your changes and commit them to the newly created branch and when you are happy with the result and positive
that it fulfills [Guidelines](#sec-guidelines). Once you are confident everything is in order, push the branch to GitHub and
[create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request), following the template that you will be prompted to fill.
