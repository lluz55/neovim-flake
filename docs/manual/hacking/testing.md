# Testing Changes {#sec-testing-changes}

Once you have made your changes, you will need to test them throughly. If it is a module, add your module option to
`configuration.nix` (located in the root of this project) inside `neovimConfiguration`. Enable it, and then run the
maximal configuration with `nix run .#maximal -Lv` to check for build errors. If neovim opens in the current directory
without any error messages (you can check the output of `:messages` inside neovim to see if there are any errors), then
your changes are good to go. Open your pull request, and it will be reviewed as soon as posssible.

If it is not a new module, but a change to an existing one, then make sure the module you have changed is enabled in the
maximal configuration by editing `configuration.nix`, and then run it with `nix run .#maximal -Lv`. Same procedure as
adding a new module will apply here.
